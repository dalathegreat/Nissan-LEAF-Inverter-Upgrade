Tuning electric vehicles can be very dangerous. I take no responsibility (see license) for any damages that this firmware might cause. You are entirely on your own when using this software. Respect your local legislation.

## How to use ?
Now that we got that out of the way, here's what you need to get started.
- A 2013-2017 Nissan LEAF (AZE0 model)
- A newer inverter from a 2018+ ZE1 LEAF (see this video for installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGBA8VPWwIg )
- A CAN-bridge with the firmware in this repository flashed onto it. The CAN-bridge attaches anywhere between the VCM and INV on EV-CAN. 

## FAQ
- Q: Why doesn't this work on my 2011-2012 LEAF? A: The early leaf has EM61 motors. These aren't compatible with the EM57 inverter style.
